Matlab codes for High Order Mimetic Sympletic Methods For Hamiltonian Systems, Anand Srinivasan, asrinivasan0709 at sdsu dot edu. 
This github page contains the Matlab codes for the High Order Mimetic Sympletic Methods For Hamiltonian Systems. This research was conducted at the Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University under the guidance of Dr. Jose Castillo. The codes utilize the Mimetic discretization coefficients that can be found in the Mimetic Operators Library Enhanced (MOLE) library in https://github.com/csrc-sdsu/mole . The arXiv preprint can be located here - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04998.pdf
